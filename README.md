# kstd
Implementations of various things in the standard library. This is just a practice project, it is incomplet, and may have some bï¿½gs. This will not have all the functionality that the standard mandates, and may not exibit behavior exactly per standard.

# Current implemented features
`kstd::string` -  An SSO-23 string implementation. About 85% as fast as the MSVC implementation. Needs to be reworked (5/22/19).

`kstd::vector` - Allocator aware vector, sometimes faster than the MSVC implementation.
